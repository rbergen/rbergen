# Hi there!

This is the probably mildly confusing collection of personal projects I have been and am working on in my spare time. 

As a CTO, I work with technology every day. It's technology that's current (ML/GenAI/Agentic AI? Check.), repeatable and scalable (Infrastructure as Code, scalable and multi-region cloud infrastructure, CI/CD? Check.), reliable and secure (reviewed, tested, ISO27001 certified? Check.), cost-effective (containerized workloads, scheduled shutdowns, reserved capacity, FinOps monitored? Check.), etc.  
That's what I do for a living, and that's what I take care of for my employer, with enthusiasm and curiosity.

The projects here are the, in some cases meandering, explorations _beyond_ that realm.
They are not:
- An indication of tech stacks I would use for modern, scalable, business-oriented solutions
- An expression of responsible standards in terms of documentation, automated testing, or code quality
- Intended to even make a lot of sense

They are an expression of an interest in the history of computing; the still-relevant bare-bone, on-the-metal underpinnings of modern-day computing; and the strange but functional ways in which one can combine those two.
Each of them has taught me new things, and in this rapidly changing world continuous learning is probably the most important thing of all.

You can reach me at rbergen@xs4all.nl if you see anything that tickles your interest.
